This code repository is a very mildly patched version of the excellent django-app-skeleton_ app generator.  Our version is intended to be used by developers at NASA.  We made some boring changes so that it generates an app licensed under the NASA Open Source Agreement instead of the Apache license.

Thanks very much to Eric Florenzano, Corey Oordt, Jose Soares, Justin Quick, and Adam Patterson for creating the generator!

Original README continues below:

==========================================
Generating a Packagable Django Application
==========================================

The ``create_app.py`` uses several variables to replace within a "template" directory. The default template directory is included and called "skel".

Running the script
==================

If you want to use the optional feature of creating a ``virtualenvwrapper`` environment for your app, ``virtualenv`` and ``virtualenvwrapper`` must be installed on your system.

The script is interactive, although you can specify some options when you call it. Calling the script is as easy as::

	python create_app.py

and the script will ask you for everything it needs. 

.. parsed-literal::

	**Application name:** django-coolapp
	**Package name [coolapp]:** 
	**Author [jcooluser]:** Johnny Cooluser
	**Destination directory [/home/jcooluser/app-skel]:** ..
	**Application template directory [/home/jcooluser/app-skel/skel]:**
	**Virtual environment name [NONE]:**

You can specify some or all of the options when calling the script.

Command-line Options
********************

-a, --author
	The name of the author.

-n, --name
	The name of the application, like 'django-coolapp'.

-p, --package
	The name of the installed package, like 'coolapp'.

-v, --virtenv
	The name of the virtualenv to create.

-d, --dest
	Where to put the new application. Relative paths are recognized.

-t, --template
	The application template to use as a basis for the new application. Relative paths are recognized.


Variable Substitution
=====================

The script creates several substitution variables that it uses to substitute for file names and within text files.


APP_NAME
	The name supplied by ``-n``\ , ``--name``\ , or the answer to *Application name*.

PKG_NAME
	The name supplied by ``-p``\ , ``--package``\ , or the answer to *Package name*. The default is the ``APP_NAME`` without ``django-``\ .

AUTHOR
	The value supplied by ``-a``\ , ``--author``\ , or the answer to *Author*. The default is the current user name.

SECRET_KEY
	A randomly generated string of characters used in the ``settings.py`` file.

VIRTENV
	The name supplied by ``-v``\ , ``--virtenv``\ , or the answer to *Virtual environment name*. The default is the ``APP_NAME``\ .

The variables are referenced by surrounding them with ``$$$$``\ , such as ``$$$$APP_NAME$$$$``\ . Here is an example from the setup.py file::

	setup(
	    name = "$$$$APP_NAME$$$$",
	    version = __import__('$$$$PKG_NAME$$$$').get_version().replace(' ', '-'),
	    url = '',
	    author = '$$$$AUTHOR$$$$',
